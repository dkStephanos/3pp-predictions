Description: 
    This file contains methods for performing feature selection in a regression context.
    It is designed to identify the most significant features for predicting target variables 
    in regression models, particularly for analyzing NBA shooting statistics.

Additional Notes:
    - Depends on scikit-learn for feature selection mechanisms.
