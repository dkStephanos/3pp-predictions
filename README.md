To run the contained app, simply execute the various jupyter notebooks in the directory. These include:

    - Preprocessing -> extends the base data set with advanced stats, visualizing the raw data, and performs LASSO based feature selection
    - Prediction -> trains a variety of models to compare performance, provides relevant statistics & learning/validation curves

# Notes
Sections of the code implemented in this repo were lifted from other NBA work contained in my github profile. Code documentation was written with AI assistance. Additional sources below:
